# E057 - Detection and Mitigation of Social Engineering Attacks

## Motivation
To create a game with C# programming and Unity software to educate the audience on the different kinds of social engineering attacks they will encounter when surfing the Internet, and how they should avoid them. In our game, we covered three types of attacks, namely:- 
* Giveaway Scams
* Email-Spoofing
* Tech Support Scams

To do so, we created a 2D game through Unity Hub. 

## How to install the project

1. You need to first have Unity in your workspace. Download Unity through [here](https://www.unity3d.com/get-unity/download).
2. Once downloaded, create a new 2D project. 
3. Download the Unity package and import it into the project.
4. Export the project 
5. Run the game, and play!
