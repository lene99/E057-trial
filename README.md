# E057 - Detection and Mitigation of Social Engineering Attacks
In this game, our aim is to educate users or players on the different kinds of social engineering attacks that they will see when surfing the Internet, and they are: 
* Giveaway Scams
* Email-Spoofing
* Tech Support Scams

To do so, we created a 2D game through Unity Hub. 

## How to install the project
